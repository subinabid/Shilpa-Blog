About a kilometer away from New Delhi railway station, Chawari Bazaar is one of the busiest metal trading markets in India. Here, we cater to two category of clients. One one end of the spectrum we have traders with banking relationship worth double digit crores, who makes this one of the largest branches in Delhi Circle. On the other end is the retail bankers of the streets of Old Delhi, who does not have an ITR or a smartphone.
